# README Standards

Create READMEs that welcome new users and get them productive fast.

## Structure

1. **Title with emoji** - Set a friendly tone (e.g., `# 📄 Project Name`)
2. **Badges** - Show Python version, license, build status
3. **One-liner** - Explain what it does in plain language
4. **Key Features** - Bullet list with emoji markers (✨)
5. **Quick Start** - Get running in 3 steps or less
6. **Detailed Usage** - Full options for power users
7. **Contributing/License** - Standard sections at bottom

## Quick Start Pattern

Always include a numbered workflow:

```markdown
## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
\`\`\`bash
git clone <repo>
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### 2. Basic Usage
\`\`\`bash
python -m myapp <input>
\`\`\`
```

## Tone Guidelines

- Use **you/your** - speak directly to the reader
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Keep code examples copy-paste ready
- Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major sections
