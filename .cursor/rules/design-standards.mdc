# Design Documentation

## Before Coding

Read relevant design docs before implementing features:
- Understand the architecture and data flow
- Check existing patterns and conventions
- Identify dependencies and interfaces

## After Coding

Update design docs if implementation changes:
- Document new patterns or architectural decisions
- Keep diagrams and data models current
- Note any deviations from original design with rationale

## Doc Standards

- Keep docs concise and actionable
- Use clear headings and structure
- Include examples where helpful
- Link to related docs when referencing other components
